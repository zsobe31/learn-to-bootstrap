    <p>This morning I woke up to dozens message from students who had read an article titled "Please Don't Learn to Code."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-12">
    <p>At first, I assumed <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/" title="Jeff Atwood">Jeff Atwood's 2012 article</a> had spontaneously reappeared on Reddit. But no â€“ this was a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code" title="Tech crunch">brand new Tech Crunch article</a> of the same name, which echoed Atwood's assertion that encouraging everyone to learn programming is like encouraging everyone to learn plumbing.</p>
